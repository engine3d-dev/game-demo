 * @name EditorWorld
 * @note Dummy implementation of our world
 * @note What does WorldScope mean?
 *      - WorldScope means you are creating a container of multiple scenes
 *      - Each container will contain a mixture of a octal-tree and BVH structure that helps to know when player enters specific scene areas
 *      - Rather then having the octal-tree per scene, we have that be part of the world structure
